# ParticleGenerator

A slapdash 1.19 plugin to generate particles continuously at given locations. Made because I couldn't find anything that let me do everything I wanted.

This plugin allows you to define locations to spawn particles at continuously, with options for interval, particle speed, offset (how large a space should the particles spawn in), and particle count. It has some issues; feel free to fix 'em yourself if you want to. As long as you're using it right, though, you shouldn't come across any real problems unless you go crazy with it.
